! Swap Y and Z keys

! The German layout has 'Y' and 'Z' swapped compared to the US layout.
! This swaps ! keycode 52 (which produces 'z' in the US layout) to 'z' and 'Z'.
! And ! keycode 29 (which produces 'y' in the US layout) to 'y' and 'Y'.
! keycode 52 = z Z
! keycode 29 = y Y
clear Lock
keycode 66 = Escape

! Define number keys as they appeared in the `xev` output
! The number row in a typical US layout includes numbers and their common shift characters.
! These are reverted back to typical US layout characters (commented out as they may already be correct).
